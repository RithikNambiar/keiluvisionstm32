# keiluvisionstm32
Keil uVision 5 projects using STM32F103C8T6
These codes/projects DO NOT make use of STM32CUBEMX software.These codes use the functions given in the header files for the mcu supplied by the manufacturer themselves.
Undestanding these codes will give you an in depth understanding of the ARM Cortex-M architecture.
usart_sabertooth.c is still under development with USART communication being completed.The logic to control the motor driver is still pending. usart_Sabertooth.c is a register level program invovling direct mnipulation of bits in registers.Use the stm32f10x technical reference manual to look up bitmaps , register maps and more.
More projects coming soon!
